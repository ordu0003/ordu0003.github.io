            <p>My name is Jessica Orduz, I'm 24 years old and a graphic designer born in  <em>Bogot√°, Colombia</em>. I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> in Canada, I moved here to learn more about a field that wasn't my forte as a designer while exploring a new culture, enjoying amazing landscapes, and improving my English skills. </p>
            
            <p>Since my 15 <sup>th</sup> birthday I've always been into arts, painting, and photography. I consider myself a very creative person that's always interested in learning. I am an outgoing person, I like to explore new places and dance. I also like to listen to music, watch series and movies. At the moment I have some hobbies like learning tattoo.</p>
